Hii korang, so kita guna this VSCode to work together to write code :)

and dont forget to create your own branch and do the code in there..

-> code in your branch and then push it in master for each changes 
and update in group.

-> each person get to do 1 file.

-> if did not know how to setup can refer youtube or pm me ifah

Hope we can complete this project as soon a possible and get good mark :>
